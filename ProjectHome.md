### Web 2.0 CMS (Content Management System) based on Yii Framework. ###

Anyone can contribute to this project, and/or share code and ideas with the development team.

CMS purpose: general.
Configurable and is free for use and modification to fit your needs.

Standards to meet: Web 2.0 using Yii PHP Framework and jQuery javascript / jQuery css Frameworks.

We will try to make it as AJAX driven as possible. But in the same time it should be functional with the javascripts disabled.

Releases date: usually once in 2-3 month(s).

```
Currently working on: Upgrading to Yii-1.1.7 and adding more models.
```
